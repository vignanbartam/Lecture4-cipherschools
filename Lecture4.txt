* features of java
  --? 1.simple
        * very easy to learn.
        * based on c++ and fimiliar to c++ coders.
        * no complicated features like pointers,operator overloading
        * automatic garbage collection.
  
  --> 2.object oriented
        * like real world, it is centered on objects,manipulating objects and making them work together.
        * better than procedural programming.
        * OOPs is secure and provide data hiding features.

  --> 3.platform independent
        * write once and run anuwhere like on windows,linux,mac.
        * additional layer (class file) is added to achieve platform independence.
        * using byte code and different JVM's for different operating systems java achieve it's independence.
   
  --> 4.architecture neutral
        * java has essential features that allows the applications to run on different machines.
        * no architecture dependencies.

  --> 5.portable
        * portable because it facilitates to carry the java bytecode to any platform.

  --> 6.robust
        * strogn/reliable
        * java removed error prone constructs that are found in other programming languages.
        * does not support pointers thus eliminationg the possibilites of overwriting memory and corrupting data.
        * storng memory allocation and garbage collection mechanism.
        * has a good exception handling mechanism.
        
  --> 7.secure
        * best known for its security.
        * does not use pointers explicitly.
        * run under an area known as the Sand Box.
        * java uses public key encryption system to allow the java applications transmit over the internet in the secured encryption form.
        * the byte code verifier checks the classes after loading.
      
  --> 8.high performance
        * faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages as its bytecode is close to native code.
        * but not as fast as c and c++.
        * new javm is faster than the old one as it uses the just in time compilation (JIT).
        
  --> 9.multi-threaded
        * single program have different independent tasks to be performed independently.
        * we can write java program tat deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads.
        * used in server applications
        * can be crated by extending thread class and by implementing runnalbe interface.
      
  --> 10.distributed
         * several computers work together.
         * java is designed to develop applications that make distributed computing easy and efficient.
